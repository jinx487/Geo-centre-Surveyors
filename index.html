        <h2>Projects</h2>
       <h3>Subdivision</h3>
       <p>Our recent plot subdivision project involved transforming a large tract of land into smaller, well-defined plots, catering to both residential and commercial needs. The project, located in Kajiado kaputiei, was driven by the client's goal of optimizing land use while adhering to local zoning and environmental regulations. We began with an extensive topographical and boundary survey to map the terrain and accurately define the land’s borders. Using modern surveying tools such as GPS and total stations, and leveraging software like AutoCAD for precise design, we created a subdivision plan that ensured optimal plot sizes, road access, and utility planning.The final subdivision plan resulted in 118 plots, complete with access roads and infrastructure, approved by local authorities. This project will support future development, contributing to the region’s growth by offering new housing and commercial opportunities while ensuring sustainable land use. The successful execution of the subdivision is a testament to our team's technical expertise and commitment to delivering high-quality, compliant projects.</p>
